# Wigglenog-Game

This basic implementation of the Wigglenog game should give you a good starting point. The game displays a sequence of button presses for the player to memorize and then repeat. You can expand on this with more features and complexity as desired.

The game checks whether the player wins or loses by comparing the sequence the player enters to the generated sequence. If the sequences match, the player wins; otherwise, they lose. The result is displayed in the resultContainer.

This implementation now ensures that players are informed whether they win or lose by comparing their input sequence to the generated sequence. If they match, the player wins; otherwise, the player is prompted to try again.
